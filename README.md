[**MvcCore**](https://github.com/mvccore/mvccore) application with standard and ajax requests to translate English into Pig-Latin.

This example is not a single file project application. If you want to see how to build a single file application with this example,  
run this example first (to see how it works) and then follow steps here on [`mvccore/example-translator-portable`](https://github.com/mvccore/example-translator-portable):

## Instalation
```shell
# load example into './my-translator' (directory is created if doesn't exist)
composer create-project mvccore/example-translator my-translator
```
